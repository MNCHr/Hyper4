### P4 Language Coverage

- [ ] Support stateful memory

Adding support for stateful memory objects will lead to support for:

- PaxOS made Switchy / NetPaxOS
- INT

- [ ] Additional primitives (TODO: identify & prioritize)

### Features

- [ ] Multicasting: Support arbitrary combinations of physical and virtual ports

Required if we want seamless abstraction regardless of actual topology

## dpmu (TODO: review design & code, update task list)
